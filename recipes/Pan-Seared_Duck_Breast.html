            <li>4 potatoes, cubed</li>
            <li>2 pints fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup apple juice</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 slices pancetta or bacon, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>6 shallots, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 pounds bok choy, sliced</li>
            <li>4 (8 ounce) boneless duck breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl mix together the salt,<br>
                ground black pepper, thyme, and rosemary; set aside. <br>
                This will be your spice blend for seasoning the roasted potatoes and the duck breasts.</li><br>

            <li>Place cubed potatoes into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle 2 tablespoons<br>
                of your spice blend over the top of the potatoes. Toss the potatoes in the pan until they are evenly<br>
                coated with oil and seasonings. Spread into a single layer across the bottom of the baking dish and bake<br>
                for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven.</li><br>

            <li>While the potatoes are roasting, stir together the blueberries, water, apple juice, sugar,<br>
                and jalapeno in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low,<br>
                and simmer until the mixture has reduced to the consistency of syrup, about 10 minutes.</li><br>

            <li>Cook the pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy. Remove the pancetta to drain on a paper towel,<br>
                leaving the drippings in the skillet. Add the shallots and the mushrooms to the hot skillet; stir and cook them until <br>
                soft and just beginning to brown. Remove the shallots and mushrooms and set aside.<br> 
                Increase heat to medium-high and place the bok choy in the hot skillet. Stir and cook the bok choy until the<br>
                leaves are wilted and the white stalk pieces are tender, about 5 minutes. Return the shallots, mushrooms,<br>
                and pancetta to the skillet, turn off the heat and set aside.</li><br>

            <li>Rinse the duck breast halves and pat dry. Rub the remaining spice blend onto both sides of the duck breasts.<br> 
                Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat, when the pan is hot put in the vegetable oil and butter. <br>
                Immediately place the duck breasts in the pan, skin and fat side down. Do not move the duck breasts until the skin is deep brown, <br>
                about 5 minutes. Turn the breasts and cook until the internal temperature of the thickest part is 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) for well done. <br>
                Remove the duck from the pan and place on a plate, covered with foil to rest for 5 minutes. <br>
                While the duck is resting, place the skillet with the bok choy mixture onto a burner over medium heat to warm through.</li><br>

            <li>Slice each duck breast diagonally into 1/2 inch strips. Divide the bok choy mixture among <br>
                four plates and drizzle each serving with 1/2 tablespoon of aged balsamic vinegar. <br>
                Arrange the sliced duck breasts on top of the bok choy mixture; ladle on blueberry sauce. <br>
                Serve with oven-roasted potatoes on the side.</li><br>
